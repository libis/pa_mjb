            The Jewish Museum of Belgium has decided to place its collection online. This will enable the public to find basic information about the items in our collections. Our inventory is being completed, and the images will be added in due course. Eventually, the entire museum collection will be available, providing you with an overview of the richness of Jewish heritage in Belgium and elsewhere.

        <h6><b>Generalities</b></h6>
        <p>
            The collections of the Jewish Museum of Belgium mainly cover Belgian Judaism from the 18th century onwards. The religious objects, through the diversity of their craftsmanship, style and provenance, recount the history of the Jews in the diaspora and that of various Jewish migrations that converged on Belgium. Conscious of the difficulty of defining a Jewish art, or even a Jewish artist, particularly from the 19th century on, the Jewish Museum of Belgium has not used unduly restrictive criteria in compiling its artistic collections. They contain the works of artists such as: El Lissitsky, Salomon Yudovin, Issashar Ryback, Idel Ianchelevici, Charles Samuel, Kurt Peiser and Felix Nussbaum. The collections also include a significant range of precious objects, textiles and documents that give an account of the social, economic and political life of the different Jewish communities and personalities in Belgium.

            The museum is trying to improve the information that accompanies each item. We invite the public and researchers to help us correct and complete the information. All suggestions should be sent to the email address below.
